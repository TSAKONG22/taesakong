# Calories Burnt Prediction

## Overview
This project estimates calories burned during physical activities based on biometric and activity data.  
It is designed for use in fitness tracking and personalized health recommendation systems.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Calories Burnt dataset  
- **Size:** Thousands of entries with features like age, height, weight, heart rate, and duration.  
- **Preprocessing:** Removed outliers, normalized continuous features, and dropped irrelevant attributes.

## Approach
- Explored relationships between physical characteristics and calorie expenditure.
- Trained and compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Evaluated models using RMSE and R².

## Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved R² of 0.92.
- Heart rate and duration were the most significant features.
