# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts used car prices based on multiple features, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Car Price dataset  
- **Size:** Several thousand records with attributes like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.  
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical variables.

## Approach
- Conducted EDA to uncover price trends and influential factors.
- Trained Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

## Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest RMSE.
- Year, brand, and mileage were the top price predictors.
