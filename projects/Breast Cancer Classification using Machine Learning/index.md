# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a classification model to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on clinical data.  
The aim is to support early cancer detection, potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset  
- **Size:** 569 instances, 30 numeric features  
- **Preprocessing:** Scaled features, handled class imbalance, and split data using stratified sampling.

## Approach
- Performed EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- Trained Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression models.
- Optimized parameters for maximum ROC-AUC and F1-score.

## Results
- SVM achieved ROC-AUC of 0.99 and accuracy of 98%.
- Strong precision and recall, making it suitable for clinical decision support.
