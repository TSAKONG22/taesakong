   Developed a predictive model to forecast product sales across various Big Mart outlets using historical sales data. Performed data cleaning to address missing values, outlier detection, and encoding of categorical variables such as outlet size and item type. Experimented with Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models, tuning hyperparameters for optimal results. Achieved significant accuracy improvements by incorporating interaction terms and normalizing numerical features. This solution helps retail managers optimize stock levels, plan promotions, and improve sales forecasting accuracy.

2. **[Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/breast-cancer-classification)**  
   Designed an ML pipeline to detect malignant and benign tumors based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance and correlations between tumor characteristics. Applied feature scaling, stratified train-test splitting, and trained Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression models. Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure clinical reliability. The approach can assist healthcare professionals in early cancer detection, potentially improving patient survival rates.

3. **[Calories Burnt Prediction](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/calories-burnt-prediction)**  
   Built a regression model to estimate calories burned during physical activities using physiological attributes like age, height, weight, heart rate, and activity duration. Performed data preprocessing including normalization and removal of multicollinear features. Compared performance of Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, selecting the best model based on RMSE and RÂ² scores. Incorporated feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of calorie expenditure. This project has practical applications for fitness trackers and health monitoring applications.

4. **[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/car-price-prediction)**  
   Created a machine learning system to predict used car prices using features such as brand, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission type. Conducted in-depth EDA to identify pricing trends and market behavior, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Applied Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting to compare performance, optimizing hyperparameters for accuracy. Achieved better price prediction through feature scaling and removal of irrelevant variables. This model can benefit car dealerships and online resale platforms to set competitive prices.

5. **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/credit-card-fraud-detection)**  
   Developed a fraud detection system for highly imbalanced credit card transaction data. Addressed data imbalance using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and tested multiple classifiers including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Focused on precision-recall trade-offs to reduce false positives while maintaining strong recall for fraud cases. Evaluated models with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and F1-score metrics. This solution can help financial institutions detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real time, minimizing losses and enhancing customer trust.

6. **[Customer Segmentation using K Means Clustering](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/customer-segmentation)**  
   Implemented an unsupervised learning approach to group customers based on purchasing patterns and demographics. Used the elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters, followed by scaling features to ensure balanced cluster formation. Created visualizations to interpret segment characteristics and inform targeted marketing strategies. Identified customer groups with distinct buying behaviors, enabling personalized promotions. This technique allows businesses to allocate marketing resources more effectively and improve customer retention.

7. **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/TSAKONG22/taesakong/tree/main/projects/heart-disease-prediction)**
