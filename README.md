## ðŸ’¼ Work / Projects

Below are 10 sample machine learning projects (currently placeholders).  
Each link takes you to the relevant project folder in this repository.

1. [Heart Disease Prediction](projects/Heart-Disease-Prediction) â€” Developed a classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient attributes such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure. Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers, achieving high accuracy after feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning. Includes visualizations of key predictors for interpretability.
2. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](projects/Credit-Card-Fraud) â€” Built a supervised machine learning pipeline to identify fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset. Used SMOTE for oversampling, trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, and evaluated performance with precision-recall metrics to minimize false positives.
3. [House Price Prediction](projects/House-Price-Prediction) â€” Created a regression model to estimate housing prices using features like location, size, and condition. Applied feature engineering (log transformation, dummy encoding) and model stacking for improved predictive accuracy. The project demonstrates end-to-end workflow from data cleaning to deployment-ready predictions.
4. [Breast Cancer Classification](projects/Breast-Cancer-Classification) â€”  Designed an SVM-based classification system to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Conducted EDA to identify correlations and improve feature selection, resulting in a robust, high-accuracy model suitable for early diagnosis assistance.
5. [Movie Recommendation System](projects/Movie-Recommendation-System) â€” Built a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering with content-based methods. Leveraged user ratings and movie metadata to deliver personalized recommendations, improving relevancy for cold-start users. Implemented using Pandas, scikit-learn, and Surprise library.
6. [Spam Mail Detection](projects/Spam-Mail-Detection) â€” Developed a Natural Language Processing pipeline to classify emails as spam or ham. Used TF-IDF vectorization with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, achieving strong precision and recall. The system includes text preprocessing steps such as stopword removal and stemming.
7. [Customer Segmentation](projects/Customer-Segmentation) â€”Applied K-means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing patterns and demographics. The insights can help businesses tailor marketing strategies to specific groups. The project includes elbow method and silhouette score analysis for optimal cluster selection.
8. [Handwritten Digit Recognition](projects/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition) â€”Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Achieved over 99% accuracy through data augmentation and model optimization. Demonstrates deep learning techniques for computer vision tasks.
9. [Stock Price Prediction](projects/Stock-Price-Prediction) â€” Implemented a time-series forecasting model using LSTM neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. Incorporated technical indicators (moving averages, RSI) as features, and evaluated results with RMSE and directional accuracy metrics.
10. [Iris Flower Classification](projects/Iris-Flower-Classification) â€” Created a classification model to identify iris flower species based on petal and sepal dimensions. Compared Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression models, with visualizations to illustrate decision boundaries. This project is a classic introduction to supervised learning workflows.
